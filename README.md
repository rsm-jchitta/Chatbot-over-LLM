**AI-Driven Equity Research Assistant**

This AI-Driven Equity Research Assistant harnesses the power of LangChain, OpenAI's language models, and Streamlit to revolutionize the equity research process for financial analysts. Developed by Khushi Bet and Akhil Chitta at the University of California, San Diego - Rady School of Management, this tool is designed to streamline the collection and analysis of vast quantities of financial data, enabling quicker, more informed investment decisions.

**Overview**
Equity research analysts are pivotal in guiding investment strategies, requiring them to analyze a plethora of information. Traditional methods, though effective, are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Our tool addresses these challenges by automating the data analysis process, leveraging cutting-edge AI and NLP technologies to provide quick, relevant insights.

**Features**
Automated Data Aggregation: Integrates with various data sources, including news articles and financial reports, to gather comprehensive market insights.
Advanced NLP Analysis: Utilizes OpenAI's language models for deep analysis of financial texts, extracting actionable insights.
Interactive Web Interface: Built with Streamlit, offering a user-friendly platform for analysts to input data and receive analyses.
Efficient Information Retrieval: Employs Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) for fast, accurate data retrieval based on query similarity.
Technical Architecture
The project integrates LangChain for bridging the gap between structured and unstructured data sources and language models. FAISS is used for its efficient similarity search capabilities, enhancing the tool's responsiveness. The user interface is powered by Streamlit, enabling easy interaction without the need for deep technical knowledge.
